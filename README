# Pose CSS

Pose (Php pOwered cSs procEssor) is a lightweight php powered css engine that allows you to use variables, mixins (functions) and includes directly in your css files. It can merge multiple stylesheets into one css file and even minify and cache it for you. Pose aims to make your stylesheets faster, smaller, easier to code and more dynamic.

Pose outputs 100% pure css, and uses standard .css files, so there's no need for proprietary file extensions or anything that wont play nice with your current stylesheets. Installation is a snap as well, simply copy a couple files to your sites css directory and your ready go. Pose is also extremely easy to customize. Most of it's internal settings can be easily accessed & modified from a well commented configuration file.

On top of pose's impressive css processing abilities, it also includes some cool extras like a collection of custom "shortcut classes", the ability to automatically include a number css frameworks (52framework, 960gs, blueprint & bluetrip currently), as well as several of the most popular reset stylesheets (YUI2,YUI3, Eric Meyer and HTML5Doctor.com).
