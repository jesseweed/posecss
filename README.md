# Pose CSS

Pose is a lightweight php powered css engine that allows you to use variables, functions, includes and more directly in your css files. It can merge multiple stylesheets into one css file and even minify and cache it for you. Pose aims to make your stylesheets faster, smaller, more dynamic and easier to code.

Pose outputs 100% pure css, and uses standard .css files, so there's no need for proprietary file extensions or anything that wont play nice with your current stylesheets. Installation is a snap as well, simply copy & paste a couple files to your sites css directory and your ready go. Pose is also extremely easy to customize. Most of it's internal settings can be easily accessed & modified from a well commented configuration file.

On top of pose's impressive css processing abilities, it also includes a powetful plugin system that lets you easily extend Pose with additional functionality to your sites and to share with the community. Some of the default plugins are a set of css helpers that can speed up your development time, a framework plugin that allows you to automatically include a number css frameworks (52framework, 960gs, blueprint & bluetrip currently), or reset plugin that will quickly add one of several popular reset stylesheets (YUI2, YUI3, Eric Meyer and HTML5Doctor.com).
